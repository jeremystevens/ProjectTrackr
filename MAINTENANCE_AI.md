# AI Feature Implementation Guidelines

This document contains important tips and best practices for the implementation of AI features in FlaskBin's premium subscription model.

## AI Features Overview

1. **AI-Generated Tags**
   - Automatically generate relevant tags for pastes based on content
   - Use language-specific models for better accuracy
   - Limit to 5-7 tags per paste

2. **AI Fix Suggestions**
   - Analyze code for errors, bugs, and potential improvements
   - Show inline suggestions with option to apply
   - Focus on common mistakes and best practices

3. **AI Code Refactoring**
   - More comprehensive rewrite suggestions for cleaner, more efficient code
   - Include explanations of why changes are recommended
   - Multiple refactoring options (readability, performance, maintainability)

4. **AI Code Summarization** ✨
   - Generate a concise explanation of what the pasted code does
   - Highlight key functions, patterns, and techniques used
   - Create documentation-style summaries adaptable by code length
   - Show directly on paste view page for premium users

5. **Free Trial Features**
   - Offer 2-3 free uses of AI features for registered (non-guest) users
   - Track usage in user profile and show "Used: X/3" counter
   - Present clear upgrade CTA when free uses are exhausted

## Subscription Implementation Roadmap

The following functionality needs to be implemented to complete the subscription system:

1. **Stripe Integration** ✅
   - Implement checkout flow for new subscriptions
   - Create webhook handlers for payment events (success, failure, cancellation)
   - Implement billing portal redirects for subscription management
   - Add Stripe API key secure storage and retrieval

2. **Plan Management** ✅
   - Show users their current plan details from database/Stripe
   - Implement clear upgrade/downgrade workflows
   - Create admin interface to manually promote/demote users
   - Implement seat sharing for Team tier

3. **Feature Restrictions** ✅
   - Gate premium features based on current subscription tier
   - Implement usage tracking for API call limits
   - Add monthly counters and automated resets
   - Create usage alert system when approaching limits

4. **Analytics** ✅
   - Implement tracking of AI feature usage for business insights
   - Create admin dashboard for monitoring service costs
   - Build reporting system for subscription revenue

## Profitability Protection Strategies

When implementing AI-powered features, follow these guidelines to protect service profitability:

1. **Queue-Based Processing** ✅
   - Implement async queue-based processing for heavy AI calls (refactoring, complex suggestions)
   - Use Celery, Redis Queue, or similar task queue systems to manage load during peak usage
   - Add rate limiting specific to AI endpoints beyond the general rate limits

2. **Result Caching** ✅
   - Cache identical AI requests to reduce redundant API calls
   - Implement time-based cache invalidation (e.g., 24 hours for most results)
   - For search queries, cache common keywords and code patterns

3. **Subscription Management** ✅
   - Offer annual plans at 10-15% discount to reduce churn and processing costs
   - Add clear usage meters in the user interface to create awareness of consumption
   - Implement tiered monthly rollover of unused credits (max 50% of monthly allocation)

4. **Feature Tiering** ✅
   - Lock advanced resource-intensive features (refactoring, complex search) to higher-tier plans
   - Make API complexity proportional to tier level (basic suggestions in Starter, code restructuring in Pro)
   - Team plan should focus on collaborative AI features, not just higher limits

5. **Conversion Optimization** ✅
   - For free users, show limited previews of AI features with clear upgrade CTAs
   - Blur or truncate full AI results for free tier (e.g., show first 25% of recommendations)
   - Offer limited-time trials of advanced features to encourage upgrades

## Implementation Guidelines

When building the AI functionality:

### Model Usage
- Use the most efficient OpenAI model for each task (code-related features may use Codex-based models)
- Set appropriate token limits for each feature to control costs
- Implement prompt engineering best practices to maximize response quality while minimizing token usage

### Request Batching
- Where possible, batch multiple small requests into single API calls
- Build client-side queuing for rapid consecutive AI requests
- Align batch timing with user experience expectations (immediate for simple tasks, background for complex tasks)

### Monitoring
- Log all AI API calls with associated metrics (tokens used, time taken, success rate)
- Set up alerting for unusual usage patterns that could indicate abuse
- Create admin dashboard with cost monitoring for AI feature usage

## Stripe Integration Guidelines

For subscription management:

- Implement metered billing for AI usage beyond tier limits
- Use Stripe webhooks to handle subscription lifecycle events
- Store usage records for auditing and reporting

## Example Usage Limits

| Plan | AI Calls/Month | AI Search Queries/Month | Max Tokens/Request | Additional Cost |
|------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Free | 0 | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Starter AI | 50 | 100 | 1,000 | $0.10 per call |
| Pro AI | 150 | 300 | 2,000 | $0.08 per call |
| Dev Team | 500 | 1,000 | 4,000 | $0.05 per call |
